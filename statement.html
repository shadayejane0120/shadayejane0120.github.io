    <p>I am an interdisciplinary artist and a craftivist. I focus on using raw materials and found objects to create functional three-dimensional forms that reference aboriginal textile design.  Most of my work attributes to unraveling social controversy regarding women, minority oppression, and colonization. I aspire to weave connections between a higher consciousness within the world and craft.

My name is Shadaye Renaye-Jane Hernandez, my family is from Guam and colonization has nearly obliterated its rich ancient culture to where it seems impossible to find any trace of art history. Spanish colonized Guam in the 17th century and island presently remains American ruled since the 1898 Spanishâ€“American War. Guam's history of colonialism is the longest among the Pacific islands. I want to bring the artistic culture of the island back to life by linking the history of colonization to the arts.  I use ancient Chamorro pottery texturing methods and painted textile design. I also use visual references of women and uplifting words to inspire reclamation of power. I work with very thinly pressed slabs of clay using a hand building slab technique to create both conceptual and functional forms. </p>
