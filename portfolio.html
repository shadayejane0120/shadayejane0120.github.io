          <h3>What makes you feel..., Audio/Video Art, 1:28, 2019</h3>
          <p>This video is about the juxtaposition between two of my many realities. The desire to support the healing of the Earth and the sensory overload of the beautiful amongst the not so beautiful events that are taking place. I chose to focus more specifically on waste management in the world. Trash not disappearing (nondegradable) and trash that disappears into the ocean. Almost two-thirds of landfill waste is biodegradable. This waste rots and decomposes, and produces harmful gases (CO2 and Methane) which are both greenhouse gases and contribute to global warming. There are many environmental, social, and cultural issues that have abetted in posing harm to the Earth and its inhabitants. This is just one interpretation that I have on this subject.</p>

              <h3>Copper, Digital Sound, 1:00, 2019</h3>
              <p>This is a collection of sounds around my home in Santa Cruz, CA. Rattling copper earrings, obsidian against metal, nail against plastic, and the flushing of a toilet. All of these sounds were combined in audacity to create “Copper”.</p>

            <h3>Reconnect, Composite Art, 2019</h3>
            <p>The concept of this project was a living rock going on vacation. It was easy for me to think about what a paradise vacation would look like to me but, what I was inspired by was my ideal vacation which would be hiking and camping near water with beautiful trees and mountains everywhere. Then, I began to think of how I have not had a real vacation in a very long time because of the responsibilities of life and how to combine my everyday surroundings with my ideal vacation. Making the vacation you would not expect to experience. Leaving the fast world behind and becoming immersed in nature, is this a concept that most of us can experience when we are on vacation? This piece can also reference the disconnect to nature that is caused by the advancement of technology. Are you really enjoying your vacation and the environment/culture around you or are you just there to get the picture that proves you were there? or Are you on "vacation" but constantly trying to connect to what you left behind for the week..work/school/friends instead of living in the moment?</p>

        <h3>Interweb Self Portrait, Net Art, 2019</h3>
        <p>An interpretation of my own self-portrait through the internet. This website consists of a collection of Tumblr blog posts I did over 4 years ago. A blog I have not had access to since and I wanted to rework the blog, making it more relatable to me here and now. I combine screenshots of my monthly calendar, social media, to-do lists and, emails. The reason I chose to combine all these aspects of my life throughout the internet was to convey that my life has been visually documented online, my thoughts, my day, my DNA.  </p>

<h3>Glitched , Digital Image, 2019</h3>
<p>The concept of this collaboration was a character that represented both the future/cyberspace and human combined. The background represents the moon, the middle of space, and the core of the earth. I glitched the group collaborated photo with audacity by turning the jpg. into a tiff. file and then importing it into audacity. Then, I selected multiple areas along 2.00-10.00 and added effects such as distortion, compression, echo, invert, and, change tempo. Next, I exported the audio file, saved it as a raw file and, opened it as a photo. WALA! A glitched copy of the group collaboration was born.</p>
